# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

THE GIT CLONE COMMAND
=====================
If you want to copy a repository from one place to your own machine. The _git clone_ command will help you do that. All you have to do is type in git clone the url link into terminal, then the repository will be copied down. This is a list of things this command does:
*Clone repository to your machine
*Store repositories to your own machine


A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.
