# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

THE GIT CLONE COMMAND
=====================
If you want to copy a repository from one place to your own machine. The _git clone_ command will help you do that. All you have to do is type in _git clone <the url link>_ into terminal, then the repository will be copied down. This is a list of things this command does:
* Clone repository to your machine
* Store repositories to your own machine
  + And more


A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.
